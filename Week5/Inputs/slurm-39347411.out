GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2018.3
Executable:   /share/apps/gromacs/2018.3/openmpi/intel/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /share/apps/gromacs/2018.3/openmpi/intel
Working dir:  /home/hv454/comp-lab-class-2023/Week5/Inputs
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -deffnm md_adp


Back Off! I just backed up md_adp.log to ./#md_adp.log.1#
Compiled SIMD: None, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file md_adp.tpr, VERSION 2018.3 (single precision)

Using 1 MPI process

Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity

NOTE: This file uses the deprecated 'group' cutoff_scheme. This will be
removed in a future release when 'verlet' supports all interaction forms.


Back Off! I just backed up md_adp.trr to ./#md_adp.trr.1#

Back Off! I just backed up md_adp.edr to ./#md_adp.edr.1#
starting mdrun 'Protein'
2500000 steps,   5000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up md_adp.gro to ./#md_adp.gro.1#
