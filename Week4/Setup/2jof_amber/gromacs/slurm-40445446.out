Lmod has detected the following error: Your site prevents the automatic
swapping of modules with same name. You must explicitly unload the loaded
version of "gromacs/openmpi/intel/2023.3" before you can load the new one. Use
swap to do this:

   $ module swap gromacs/openmpi/intel/2023.3 gromacs/openmpi/intel/2020.4

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable
LMOD_DISABLE_SAME_NAME_AUTOSWAP to "no" to re-enable same name autoswapping.

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
